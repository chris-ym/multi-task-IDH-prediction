# Multi-task time-series prediction by transformer-based model
1. We propose two neural networks -- "Respective Training Net (RTNet)" & "Combined Training Net (CTNet)", which are transformer-based models. Both two models also have two outputs used for multi-task time-series prediciton.
2. In my paper, we used the two models to predict real-time Intradialytic hypotension & Systolic blood pressure, in order to monitor the condition of patients during hemodialysis.
3. Owing to data security for clinical data, we use [pollution](https://data.world/data-society/us-air-pollution-data) data by [data.world](https://data.world/)
